# Hi, I'm Marfilho Fidel Alvares Pereira ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer based in Timor-Leste, currently working in one of the Timor-Leste Government Institutions. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning PHP and JavaScript to create an Information System in my workplace as a Developer. I'm also very interested in creating websites using WordPress. Additionally, I have a passion for Python programming, especially in the context of data analysis and artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

- ðŸ’¼ I work at one of the Timor-Leste Government Institutions, where I'm developing a system to manage human resources and civil servant data.

- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from one of the best universities in Timor-Leste, UNTL, with a good GPA in 2020.

- In my free time, I enjoy teaching web development using PHP and PostgreSQL in the open-source community in Timor-Leste called [FDSL](https://www.fdsl.tl/). I also teach about open source and Linux operating systems.

## My Projects

Here are some projects I'm currently working on:

1. **[Point of Sale](https://github.com/marfilhofap/Point-of-Sale):** This is a system I developed using PHP and PostgreSQL for a CAFFEE. It allows customers to place orders for food and drinks, and the system generates daily, monthly, and annual reports to help manage the business efficiently.

2. **[FDSL Information System](https://github.com/marfilhofap/FDSL):** The FDSL Information System is a comprehensive platform for managing data and activities in Timor-Leste Open Source Community or FDSL. It serves as a centralized hub for organizing, recording, and sharing information related to open source and Linux activities.

3. **[Web Development Basics (FDSL)](https://github.com/marfilhofap/WEB-DEVELOPMENT):** This repository contains the code I teach to my students during weekend sessions. It covers the fundamentals of web development using PHP and PostgreSQL. Students can access and copy the code from this GitHub repository as part of their learning journey.

Feel free to explore these projects for more details and updates!
